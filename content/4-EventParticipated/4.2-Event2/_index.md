# Key Presentation Highlights

## 1. The Architecture Battle: Virtual Machines vs. Containers

- **Fundamental Differences:** VMs are "Heavyweight" because they run a separate Guest OS on a Hypervisor, leading to slow boot times (minutes) and high resource consumption. Meanwhile, Containers (Docker) are "Lightweight," sharing the Host OS, and booting up in milliseconds.

- **Optimization:** Containers help package applications (App + Bins/Lib) compactly, delivering Native performance, saving RAM, and allowing hundreds to thousands of containers to run on the same infrastructure instead of just a few dozen VMs.

---

## 2. Challenges in Serverless Deployment (AWS Lambda & DynamoDB)

- **State Management (Stateless Lambda):** AWS Lambda does not store data in memory between requests. All states (e.g., Game state) must be continuously queried and stored in DynamoDB, requiring clever architectural design to avoid latency.

- **Cost Issues (DynamoDB Scan Cost):** Using the `ScanCommand` to scan entire datasets (e.g., finding a player in a table) becomes increasingly slow and expensive as the system scales up. Optimization via Query and Index is necessary.

- **Stale Connections (GoneException):** Effectively handling abruptly disconnected players so the Matchmaking system does not send wasted messages.

## 3. WAF & Machine Learning for Network Intrusion Detection Systems

**Speaker:** Le Hoang Gia Dai

- **Limitations of Signature-based Detection:** Analyzed why traditional signature-based WAF rules are insufficient against modern attacks (Zero-day, Behavioral anomalies).

- **NIDS Solution with ML:** Using Machine Learning for behavior-based detection. The model is trained on the standard `CSE-CIC-IDS2018` dataset.

- **Operational Workflow:** Building a real-time dashboard for monitoring, then correlating predictions from NIDS with AWS WAF events to enhance threat detection capabilities in Cloud environments.

## 4. Career Journey: From Sysadmin to DevOps

**Speaker:** Tran Trung Vinh

- **Mindset Shift:** Cloud is not just a new technology; it is a "new way of thinking." Moving from manual installation to automation (Infrastructure as Code).

- **Interview Experience:** Valuable lessons and personal development strategies drawn from the interview process at large corporations (Central Retail Group).

---

# Key Takeaways

## Architectural & Cloud Mindset

- **Right Tool for the Right Job:** No technology is absolutely perfect. Depending on cost and performance requirements, choose VM or Container; design databases carefully to avoid cost overruns (Scan vs. Query).

- **DevOps Mindset:** Infrastructure is now treated as "Code". System stability relies heavily on automation and monitoring capabilities.

---

## Modern Security Mindset

Gained a deeper understanding of the limits of static rules in Firewalls/WAFs. Modern security inevitably requires AI/ML intervention to analyze abnormal network patterns rather than relying solely on known rules.

---

# Personal Application & Action Plan

- **Packaging Personal Projects:** Instead of running Java (Spring Boot) or Python (Flask) applications directly on the host machine and causing environment conflicts, I will start writing `Dockerfile`s to containerize my web apps, making deployment to servers much easier.

- **Upgrading Security Mindset (SIEM/Wazuh):** The knowledge from Mr. Gia Dai's session on WAF + ML perfectly complements my security research direction. I can apply this "Event Correlation" mindset to the Wazuh SIEM system to write more effective custom rules for my "Session Hijacking and Fixation Prevention" project.

- **Cloud Cost Control:** If I deploy small demos on AWS in the future, the lesson on `DynamoDB Scan Cost` will help me be more cautious in database design to avoid exceeding the Free Tier limits.

# Event Reflection & Experience

The AWS First Cloud Journey event provided a highly "Industry-focused" perspective rather than just textbook theory.

## Technical Perspective

Seeing the actual architectures deployed by AWS teams helped me visualize the path to becoming a Systems/Security Engineer more clearly. Dissecting the "weaknesses" of Serverless (like Stateless Lambda) demonstrated the speakers' deep expertise.

## Career Orientation

The session sharing the journey from IT Helpdesk to Sysadmin and DevOps by Mr. Trung Vinh was highly motivating. It outlined a clear roadmap, helping students like me know what skill sets to equip (from OS and Network to Cloud and Automation) to prepare for upcoming interviews.

## Event Atmosphere

Professional yet open. The case studies on applying AI to WAF truly opened a new direction for the information security projects I am pursuing.

> In short, the event served as a perfect bridge between the Network Administration/Security knowledge I am learning in school and practical enterprise Cloud standards. It reinforced my determination to master network infrastructure and integrate AI into security workflows.
